\abstract{

These guidelines are provided for the preparation of \textbf{full papers} submitted to ISPRS events (Congress, Geospatial Week, Symposia, smaller events such as workshops). Full papers undergo a double-blind review process. Therefore, the submissions have to be anonymised. If this process leads to acceptance, subsequently a camera-ready manuscript must be submitted following these guidelines (but, of course, incl. author names and affiliation). Depending on the recommendations of the reviewers and the decision of the local programme chair this camera-ready manuscript will be published either in the ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences or The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, provided it arrives by the due date and corresponds to the guidelines.
These guidelines are issued to ensure a uniform style for all submitted papers and throughout these two series. To assure timely and efficient production of the Annals and Archives with a consistent and easy to read format, authors must submit their manuscripts in strict conformance with these guidelines. The Society may omit any paper that does not conform to the specified requirements.

\subsection{General Instructions}\label{sec:General Instructions}

The paper should have the following structure:

%\itemize
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}\setlength\parskip{0em}\setlength\topsep{0em}\setlength\partopsep{0em}\setlength\parsep{0em}
\item{Title of the paper}
\item{Author(s) and affiliation, \textbf{anonymized} for the double-blind review process}
\item{Keywords (5--8 words)}
\item{Abstract (100--250 words)}
\item{Introduction}
\item{Main body}
\item{Conclusions}
\item{Acknowledgements,  \textbf{anonymized} for the double-blind review process}
\item{References}
\item{Appendix (if applicable)}
\end{enumerate}

% KAO: Use proper quotes
Full papers \textbf{submitted for double-blind review} must not contain any information which makes it possible to identify the author(s). In particular, name(s) and affiliation(s) must be removed from the manuscript submitted for review. Also sentences such as ''As we have shown in previous work (Author\_x, 20xx)'' are to be avoided. Instead use a formulation such as ''Author\_x (20xx) has shown ...''. Note that submissions which have not been appropriately anonymised may be subject to immediate rejection.\\

In case, the contribution has been accepted for publication, a camera-ready manuscript must be submitted at the due date. In this camera-ready manuscript the name(s) and affiliation(s) of the authors(s) must be identified, and acknowledgements can be personalized. An example of a camera-ready manuscript can be found under www.isprs.org/documents/orangebook/app5.aspx.

\subsection{Page Layout and Length}\label{sec:Page Layout, Spacing and Margins}
The paper must be compiled in one column for the title, author information, key words and abstract and in two columns for all subsequent text. Left and right justified typing is mandatory. All manuscripts, except Invited Papers are limited to a length of approximately 8 single-spaced pages (A4 size), including abstracts, figures, tables and references. ISPRS Invited Papers are limited to approximately 12 pages. In any case, the minimum length of any paper is 6 pages. The font type Times New Roman with a size of 9 pts. is to be used.

% KAO: Removed spacing before label: can cause references to be wrong

\subsection{Style guides}\label{sec:Preparation in electronic form}

% KAO: Remove newline
To assist authors in preparing their contributions, style guides are provided in Word and/or LaTeX on the ISPRS web site, see www.isprs.org/documents/orangebook/app5.aspx. Use of these style guides ensures that the paper is correctly formatted and is therefore strongly suggested.


\section{TITLE AND ABSTRACT BLOCK}\label{sec:TITLE AND ABSTRACT BLOCK}

\subsection{Title}\label{sec:Title}

The title must appear centred in \textbf{BOLD CAPITAL LETTERS}, at the top of the first page with a size of 12 pts. Any author information must be masked in the full paper submitted for double-blind peer review.

Author(s) name(s), affiliation and mailing address only appear in the camera-ready manuscript, which is to be submitted after the paper is accepted for publication. For this camera-ready manuscript, type the author(s) name(s), affiliation and mailing address (including e-mail) in upper and lower case letters, centred under the title. For the author names, use the initial for the first name, followed by the complete last name. In the case of multi-authorship, indicate which author belongs to which organisation, and indicate the corresponding author by the symbol * after the name. Explain the * symbol as a foot note at the bottom of the first page, see example for a camera-ready manuscript at www.isprs.org/documents/orangebook/app5.aspx.

%\subsection{ISPRS Affiliation (optional)}\label{sec:ISPRS Affiliation (optional)}

% KAO: Use proper quotes
%For those authors affiliated with a specific Commission and/or Working Group of
%ISPRS, a separate title may be entered. The title should be centred in bold type
%after one blank line below the author's affiliation, i.e. Commission~\#, Working Group~\#.
%The Commission number shall be Roman and the Working Group number should be the Commission
%Roman number, slash, WG Arabic number (see example above).


\subsection{Key Words}\label{sec:Key Words}

% KAO: Use proper quotes and dash
Leave two lines blank, then type \textbf{``KEY WORDS:''}
in bold capital letters, followed by 5--8 key words. Note that ISPRS does not provide a set
list of key words. Therefore, include those key words which you would
use to find a paper with content you are preparing.


\subsection{Abstract}\label{sec:Abstract}

% KAO: Use proper quotes and dash
Leave two blank lines under the key words. Type \textbf{``ABSTRACT:''}
flush left in bold Capitals followed by one blank line. Note that the abstract should be concise (100 - 250 words), present briefly the content and very importantly, the scientific contribution and results of the paper in words understandable also to non-specialists.


\section{MAIN BODY OF TEXT}\label{sec:MAIN BODY OF TEXT}

Type text single-spaced, \textbf{with} one blank line between paragraphs and
following headings. Start paragraphs flush with left margin.


\subsection{Headings}\label{sec:Headings}

% KAO: Remove explicit newlines in this section
Major headings are to be centred, in bold capitals without
underlining, after two blank lines and followed by a one blank line.

Type subheadings flush with the left margin in bold upper case and lower
case letters. Subheadings are on a separate line between two single blank lines.

Subsubheadings are to be typed in bold upper case and lower case letters
after one blank line flush with the left margin of the page, with text
following on the same line. Subsubheadings may be followed by a period
or colon, they may also be the first word of the paragraph's sentence.

Use decimal numbering for headings, subheadings and subsubheadings.


\subsection{Footnotes}\label{sec:Footnotes}

Mark footnotes in the text with a number (1); use consecutive numbers for following footnotes. Place footnotes at the bottom of the page, separated from the text above it by a horizontal line.


\subsection{Figures and Tables}\label{sec:Illustrations and Tables}

\subsubsection{Placement:}\label{sec:Placement}

Figures must be placed in the appropriate location in the document, as close as practical to the reference of the figure in the text. While figures and tables are usually aligned horizontally on the page, large figures and tables can be rotated by 90 degrees. If so, make sure that the top is always on the left-hand side of the page.

\subsubsection{Captions:}\label{sec:Captions}

All captions should be typed in upper and lower case letters,
centred directly beneath the illustration. Use single spacing if they
use more than one line. All captions are to be numbered consecutively,
e.g. Figure~1, Figure~2, Figure~3, ..  and Table~1, Table~2, Table~3, ...

Commons Unported License} and you retain the copyright.


\subsection{Equations, Symbols and Units}\label{sec:Equations, Symbols and Units}

\subsubsection{Equations:}\label{sec:Equations}

Equations should be numbered consecutively throughout the contribution. The equation
number is enclosed in parentheses and placed flush right. Leave one blank lines
before and after equations:


\begin{equation}\label{equ:1}
	x = x_0 -c \frac{X - X_0}{Z - Z_0}; y = y_0 -c \frac{Y - Y_0}{Z - Z_0},
\end{equation}

\begin{tabbing}
where \hspace{0.6cm} \= $c$ = principle distance\\
\> $x,y$ = image coordinates\\
\> $X_0,Y_0, Z_0$ = coordinates of projection centre\\
\> $X, Y, Z$ = object coordinates
\end{tabbing}

\subsubsection{Symbols and Units:}\label{sec:Symbols and Units}
